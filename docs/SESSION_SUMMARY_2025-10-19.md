---

## Part 1: Issue Topics - Research-Based Selection

### Problem
Original issue topics were generic placeholders not backed by data on what citizens actually care about.

### Solution
Researched and implemented top 10 issues for young voters (ages 18-35) based on:
- Harvard Kennedy School Youth Poll (Fall 2024)
- Pew Research Center generational studies
- AP-NORC young voter surveys

### New Issue Topics (Ordered by Salience)
1. Climate Change & Environmental Policy
2. Economy, Jobs & Wages
3. Housing Affordability & Rent Costs
4. Healthcare Access & Costs
5. Gun Policy & Community Safety
6. Reproductive Rights & Abortion Access
7. Education Costs & Student Debt
8. Immigration & Border Policy
9. Criminal Justice & Police Reform
10. Voting Rights & Election Integrity

### Implementation
- **File:** `app/components/IssuePicker.tsx`
- **Documentation:** `docs/ISSUE_TOPICS.md` (comprehensive methodology guide)
- **Approach:** Neutral framing to support both "support" and "oppose" stances

**Benefits:**
- Data-driven topic selection
- Higher relevance to target demographic
- Quarterly review process documented
- Nonpartisan framing maintained

**Commits:** 00d654b

## Part 2: Impact Analysis Documentation

### Created: `docs/IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md`

Comprehensive research-based analysis comparing civic action tools vs. public protests in terms of democratic impact.

**Key Findings:**
- **Protests:** Excellent for awareness, mobilization, movement-building
- **Civic Action (constituent letters):** Excellent for direct policy influence
- **Research:** Congressional Management Foundation study shows personalized letters are #1 most influential form of constituent communication (10x more than petitions)

**Content:**
- Political science research citations
- CMF study data
- Comparison matrices
- Optimal strategy: protests for awareness → Civic Action for policy change

**Purpose:**
- Grant applications (evidence-based impact)
- Pitch materials
- User education
- Partnership conversations

**Commits:** 0c53c79

## Part 3: Congress.gov API Integration (Bill Autocomplete)

### Problem
Users had to manually type bill numbers with no guidance or validation.

### Solution
Integrated Congress.gov API to provide intelligent bill autocomplete.

### Features Implemented

**API Endpoint:** `/api/bills/search`
- Queries Congress.gov API for 118th Congress bills
- Searches by bill number (e.g., "HR 1234") or title keywords (e.g., "climate")
- Returns: bill number, title, latest action status, date
- **Caching:** 1-hour revalidation to stay within API limits
- **Rate limit:** 5,000 requests/hour (free tier)
- **Graceful degradation:** Works without API key (feature optional)

**UI Implementation:** Updated `IssuePicker.tsx`
- Debounced search (300ms after typing stops)
- Dropdown with bill suggestions
- Displays: bill number, full title (truncated), status
- Click to auto-fill bill number
- Clean, accessible design

**User Experience:**
- Type "HR 12" → see HR 1234, HR 1256, etc.
- Type "climate" → see all climate-related bills
- Type "healthcare" → see healthcare bills
- See status like "Passed House" or "In Committee"

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `app/api/bills/search/route.ts` - API endpoint
- Updated `app/components/IssuePicker.tsx` - UI with autocomplete

**Environment:**
- `CONGRESS_API_KEY` added to `.env.local.example`
- Optional: app works without it

**Technical:**
- Edge runtime for fast global response
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- React hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef
- Debounced search to minimize API calls

**Commits:** 9183a49
