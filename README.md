üåê **Live at: [takecivicaction.org](https://takecivicaction.org)**

A web app that makes it simple for citizens to contact their representatives with well-crafted, respectful messages. Enter an address, pick an issue, and get a ready-to-send email draft for every official from local to federal level‚Äîenabling meaningful dialogue that strengthens democracy.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key (required for email drafting)
- Congress.gov API key (optional for bill autocomplete)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd civic-action
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up API Keys

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then add your API keys to `.env.local`:

**OpenAI API (Required):**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Congress.gov API (Optional - for bill autocomplete):**
1. Go to [Congress.gov API](https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/)
2. Sign up for a free API key (5,000 requests/hour)
3. Copy the key to `CONGRESS_API_KEY`

**Note:** The app will work without the Congress API key, but bill autocomplete won't be available.

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 4. Test It Out

Try entering a test address:
- **1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500** (White House)
- Your own address

Then:
1. Pick an issue and stance (support/oppose)
2. Optionally add bill number, personal impact, desired action
3. Click "Generate email draft" for any official
4. Copy the draft or click "Open in Mail"
